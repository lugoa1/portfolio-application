# portfolio-application
this is my portfolio application.
i know that its not responsive to reduced window size, i couldnt figure out how flexbox worked and 
tried to avoid media queries as they are very cumbersome. when i did figure out how flexbox worked, 
i couldnt get it to work with the website as it continued to break the website, moving things around 
and deleting h1s and many other things off my page. in the future my web applications will have flexbox 
applied to them before i do anything else to avoid the problems of my first website.
